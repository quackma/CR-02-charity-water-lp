                    Twelve-year-old Tarik Haftay lives in a small village nestled high in the hills of Tigray, Ethiopia. She lives with her mother, father, three sisters, and brother. As the oldest child, Tarik carries a lot of responsibility. Every day, she helps her family by collecting firewood, sweeping the house, cooking meals, feeding the animals, and doing whatever she can so her mother has more time to work. But Tarik’s biggest responsibility is collecting water for her family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right before heading to school each morning, Tarik walks nearly thirty minutes down a steep hill to fill her jerry can with forty pounds of dirty water from a small stream. Not only is the water unsafe to drink, but it’s also scarce—especially during the dry season. The stream is shared by nearly 1,825 other people, and animals drink from it as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tarik’s life is difficult, but change is coming. Organizations working in Tigray are building clean water systems that will one day bring safe, running water to every home. When that day arrives, Tarik won’t have to spend her mornings walking for water. She’ll be free to wake up, wash her face, and head straight to school—ready to learn, to grow, and to dream.
